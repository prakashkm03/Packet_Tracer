Some of my works on Packet Tracer

## Introduction
Packet Tracer is a cross-platform visual simulation tool designed by Cisco Systems that allows users
to create network topologies and imitate modern computer networks. The software allows users to
simulate the configuration of Cisco routers and switches using a simulated command line interface.
Packet Tracer makes use of a drag and drop user interface, allowing users to add and remove
simulated network devices as they see fit. The software is mainly focused towards Certified Cisco
Network Associate Academy students as an educational tool for helping them learn fundamental
CCNA concepts.
